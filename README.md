I have started watching the vedios and after completely watched the first one I have got an idea about where ,how and about what we are going to do(how to install a yii website using composer and setup a local website that we can use to work on  this site).
Then at first i have created a Github account and have learnt how to create a repository,create branches and how to send pull requests and finally merge them.Then I got to kknow about the working experience in Github, like getting to know how projects will be done in a group manner (everyone contributing to the project and merging them).
