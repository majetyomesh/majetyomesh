my learning experience
At first I have learnt how to install an OS(Ubuntu) and started working in it.
I have started watching the vedios and after completely watched the first one I have got an idea about where ,how and about what we are going to do(how to install a yii website using composer and setup a local website that we can use to work on  this site).
Then at first i have created a Github account and have learnt how to create a repository,create branches and how to send pull requests and finally merge them.Then I got to kknow about the working experience in Github, like getting to know how projects will be done in a group manner (everyone contributing to the project and merging them).
framework-try to reinvent things that people have already worked on.
         -dont repeat the same mistakes other people have made

I have got to know the requirements for yii2 and have started to install these.I have got to know that the use of working with yii and yii2 and have completed watching all the vedios with simultaneous installation of these requirements.I have installed php.
I have installed mysql ith its work bench and also installed netbeans(IDE) with jdk.
i also installed yii2 using composer.Then I tried to create a new site using the apache server which I have failed and unable to identify the mistake as everything is running proper .I have browsed various ways to test all the installed files like php etc, and found that everything is installed properly but still getting things like fatal erroes,etc; 
I have watched the next two vedios and got to learn about them but could not implement them.
I have learned how to create a project and work with it.Got to learn about the source files like config, models , web , migrations ,runtime, tests, vendors,views.Learned to create new tables and add records to itand make changes using modal generator.
Learned how to restrict access for deleting records,create using CRUD generator.
